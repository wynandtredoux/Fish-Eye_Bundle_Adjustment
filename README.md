# Fish-Eye_Bundle_Adjustment
 Bundle Adjustment program using the equidistant fish-eye projection model

## Development Stages
### Stage 1 - Completed
	Implement the model to solve only for the exterior orientation parameters (EOPs) of multiple images with fixed object points (control points)
### Stage 2 - Completed
	Implement the inner constraints adjustment
### Stage 3 - Completed
	Add estimation of the principal distance, principal point and distortion model coefficients for a single camera (i.e. one set of interior orientation parameters, IOPs)
